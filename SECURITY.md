Security policy
===============
**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, you can report them using [our security page](https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/security). Alternatively, you can also send them
by email to security+ntpdrs@tweedegolf.com.

Include as much of the following information:

 * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow overflow, privilege escalation, etc.)
 * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
 * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
 * If applicable, which platforms are affected
 * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
 * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

## Preferred Languages
We prefer to receive reports in English. If necessary, we also understand Dutch.

## Disclosure Policy
We adhere to the principle of [responsible disclosure](https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/CVD/Executive+Summary).

Security Advisories
===================
Security advisories will be published [on GitHub](https://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs/security/advisories)
and possibly through other channels.
